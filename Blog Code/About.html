  <h3>The About page</h3>

  <p>This blog was started in early 2019 as a means to document<br>
     my game development progress and also the progress of this site.<br>
     It was initially hosted on blogger.com until I finished the version<br>
     one for the site. At that point I opted to replace my premade site on<br>
     blogger with this one.<br>
